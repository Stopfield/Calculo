# Trabalho de CÃ¡lculo
A little homework of Calculus

The program calculates the amount of error in each method of integration. Those being:
  Using the left side of the rectangle (ESQ(n)).
  Using the right side of the rectangle (DIR(n)).
  Using the medium point of the rectangle (MED(n)).
  Using the trapezium method (TRAP(n)).
  Using the Simpson method (SIMP(n)).


The code is in portuguese, future work will translate it to English.
I think I overcomplicated this, it should be revised. If someone could help me improve the code, I'd be grate.
